<h1>JavaScript Projects</h1>
Welcome to my JavaScript projects repository! Here, I've compiled a series of projects to enhance my understanding of JavaScript while I embark on this learning journey. Below are brief descriptions of each project:

<h2>1. Quote Generator</h2>
A simple yet inspiring project that randomly selects quotes from a predefined list and presents them to users. Perfect for a quick dose of motivation!

<h2>2. Stopwatch</h2>
In this project, I've implemented a functional stopwatch using JavaScript. Users can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, making it a handy tool for tracking time during various activities.

<h2>3. Todo List</h2>
Stay organized and productive with this to-do list application. Developed with JavaScript, users can effortlessly add, remove, and mark tasks as completed, facilitating efficient task management.

Feel free to explore these projects and dive into the code. I'm continuously learning and refining my skills, so any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
